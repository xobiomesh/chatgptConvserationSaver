**User:** Write a script to automate sending daily email reports in Python, and walk me through how I would set it up.

**Assistant:** To automate sending daily ```
```
email
```
``` reports in Python, you'll need to use the ```
```
smtplib
```
``` and email libraries. Here's a step-by-step guide to set it up:

Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries

First, make sure you have the required libraries. smtplib and email are part of the Python Standard Library, so you don't need to install them separately. However, if you plan to read data from files or databases for your reports, you might need additional libraries such as ```
pandas
```.

```
sh
Copy code
```
pip install pandas

```
```
Step 2: Create the Python Script

Create a new Python script file in VSCode, let's name it ```
daily_email_report.py
```.

```
python
Copy code
```
import smtplib
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

def send_email(subject, body, to_email):
    # Email configuration
    from_email = "your_email@example.com"
    from_password = "your_password"
    smtp_server = "smtp.example.com"
    smtp_port = 587

    # Create the email
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = from_email
    msg['To'] = to_email
    msg['Subject'] = subject

    msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))

    # Send the email
    try:
        server = smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port)
        server.starttls()
        server.login(from_email, from_password)
        server.send_message(msg)
        server.quit()
        print("Email sent successfully")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to send email: {e}")

def ```
create_report
```():
    # Sample data for the report
    data = {
        'Date': [datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")],
        'Metric1': [123],
        'Metric2': [456],
        'Metric3': [789]
    }

    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    return df.to_string(index=False)

def main():
    subject = "```
Daily
``` Report"
    body = create_report()
    to_email = "recipient@example.com"
    
    send_email(subject, body, to_email)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```
```
Step 3: Schedule the Script

To automate this script to run daily, you can use Windows Task Scheduler.

1. Open Task Scheduler
Press ```
Win + R
```, type ```
taskschd.msc
```, and press Enter.
2. Create a ```
```
New
```
``` Task
In the Task Scheduler, click on ```
Create Task
```.
Name your task, e.g., "Daily Email Report".
3. Set the Trigger
Go to the ```
Triggers
``` tab, click New.
Set the task to begin Daily and specify the start time.
4. Set the Action
Go to the ```
Actions
``` tab, click New.
In the ```
Program/script
``` box, type the path to your Python executable (e.g., ```
C:\Python39\python.exe
```).
In the ```
Add arguments
``` box, type the path to your script (e.g., ```
C:\path\to\your\script\daily_email_report.py
```).
5. Save and Test
Save the task and run it manually to test if the email is sent correctly.
Notes:
Make sure your email provider allows SMTP access and you have the correct SMTP server details.
For security reasons, consider using environment variables or a secure vault to store email credentials instead of hardcoding them.

This script creates a simple email with a text report. You can customize the create_report function to generate more complex reports as needed.
