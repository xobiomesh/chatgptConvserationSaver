# ChromeDevAI 🚀

## Overview 📖
**ChromeDevAI** is an innovative project aimed at enhancing the developer experience by integrating AI capabilities directly into the Chrome Developer Console. This project started with a simple script that saves OpenAI ChatGPT conversations locally and aims to evolve into a full-fledged Chrome extension with powerful AI features.

## Current Status 🛠️
### Script Functionality
- **Current Feature:** The script can be executed in the Chrome Developer Console to save the chat from OpenAI ChatGPT conversations to a specified file locally.

## Goals 🎯
1. **Short-Term:** Create a Chrome extension that can save ChatGPT conversations to a file.
2. **Long-Term:** Develop a Chrome extension that embeds AI into the Chrome Developer Console, allowing users to interact with the AI about a website's code and functions. Users will be able to retrieve information from the devtools through natural language.
